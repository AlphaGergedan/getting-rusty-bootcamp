# Requirements

If you haven't done so please install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Requirements to solve the exercises:
- Rust installation
- Git
- Text editor

You should start by cloning this repository using `git clone git@github.com:AlphaGergedan/getting-rusty-bootcamp.git`
and then navigate to the `exercises` folder.

# Exercises for lecture 3: Idiomatic Rust and functional programming features

We will be building a simple library management system to practice some of the
idiomatic features we have seen. You will be implementing the `src/library.rs` and `src/book.rs`
to make the exercises pass (run without panicking) gradually. Make sure to start with exercise 1
and move to the next exercise as you complete them. If you are stuck, you can find the solutions
under `src/solutions`.

You should solve the exercises in the following format:
- Edit `src/main.rs` to run the examples till the current exercise you are solving.
- See `src/exercisesX.rs` to see the usage examples and get an idea on what you should be focusing on for the current exercise.
- Edit `src/library.rs` or `src/book.rs` depending on the exercise to gradually implement the library system.
- Run `cargo run` on the project root to run the exercises with your solution.

Have fun!
